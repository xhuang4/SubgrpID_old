Description: Function Wrapper contains four algorithms for developing threshold-based multivariate (prognostic/predictive) biomarker signatures via bootstrapping and aggregating of thresholds from trees, Monte-Carlo variations of the Adaptive Indexing method and Patient Rule Induction Method. Variable selection is automatically built-in to these algorithms. Final signatures are returned with interaction plots for predictive signatures. Cross-validation performance evaluation and testing dataset results are also output.
